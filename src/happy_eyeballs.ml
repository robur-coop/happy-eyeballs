(* A connection is attempted to [set of ips] * [sequence of ports], with the
   first successful socket being returned.

   The [set of ips] is either provided manually or by DNS resolution.
   Connections to IPv6 addresses is prefered, and connection attempts are mixed
   between IP protocols (first, an IPv6, then IPv4, then IPv6, ...) if
   available. If only one protocol family is available, this is used. *)

(* The state machine of a connection, constructors
   - connect (initial state: Resolving, actions: Resolve_a & Resolve_aaaa)
   - connect_ip (initial state: Connecting, action: Connect)

   Since resolution is done in parallel for IPv4 and IPv6 (and both may result
   in failure), that is tracked as well (in the "resolved" field of a
   connection, this transition is done before state transition):
